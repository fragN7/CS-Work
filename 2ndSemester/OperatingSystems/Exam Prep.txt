a not b:
^[^b]*a+[^b]*$

A B C /bin/echo:
"A\n" exec call replaces process, cuz its succesfull
echo will print A and also new line character

pipe(p) dup2(p[1], 1):
dup2(p[0], 0)

risk on mutex threads:
risk of deadlock cuz every mutex blocks the other mutex

barrier:
T = N1 = N2 = N3 = 3, number of threads == T and everything

3 process fifo:
first rdonly then wronly

n++ add to code:
initialize and lock mutexes 

hard-link:
Because inodes are unique to a filesystem,
 and hard links are mappings of name:inode,
 you cannot create links across filesystems.

singur fifo citire:
la final de cod gen lol
